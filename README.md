Basic Setup:
Board: The board typically has 6 small pits on each side and 2 larger pits (one for each player) called "stores" or "mancalas."
Seeds: Each small pit starts with a certain number of seeds or stones.
Objective:
The goal is to collect as many seeds as possible in your store.
How to Play:
Choose a Pit: On your turn, pick up all the seeds from one of your pits.
Distribute Seeds: Move the seeds one by one into the pits moving counterclockwise around the board.
You drop one seed into each pit, including the stores, but you skip the opponent's store.
If you reach your store, put one seed in it, and continue placing seeds in the pits until they are all distributed.
Capture Seeds: If the last seed you place lands in an empty pit on your side, you capture the seeds in the opposite pit (from your opponent's side) and add them to your store.
Winning:
The game ends when one side of the board is empty.
The player with the most seeds in their store wins.
Key Points:
Strategy: Decide which pit to pick from to maximize your seeds in your store or capture seeds from your opponent.
Turn-Based: Players alternate turns.
**In summary, Mancala involves picking and distributing seeds to gain the most in your store, while strategically capturing seeds from your opponent.**
